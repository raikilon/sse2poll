SSE2Poll provides a drop‑in annotation and infrastructure that turn slow server computations into robust long-poll workflows. The Java core library plugs into any Spring/Spring Boot app via @PolledGet, orchestrating kickoff + polling with Caffeine-backed caching and async execution. The repository also ships an example REST API that demonstrates the flow end-to-end, and it’s slated to grow with an Angular client library that speaks the same polling protocol for seamless backend/frontend integration.
