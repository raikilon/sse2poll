SSE2Poll provides a drop-in annotation and infrastructure that turn slow server computations into robust long-poll workflows. The Java core library plugs into any Spring/Spring Boot app via @PolledGet, orchestrating kickoff + polling with Caffeine-backed caching and async execution. The repository also ships an example REST API that demonstrates the flow end-to-end, plus a lightweight Angular-only polling client under `client/polling-client`. See `client/polling-client/README.md` for usage.
